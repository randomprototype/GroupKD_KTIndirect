**Cost-Rate and Cost-Saving Calculations for Indirect Grouping actions in Hybrid Inspection/Age-Based Policies**

Welcome to the source code for our Streamlit application! This tool calculates the cost-rate and cost-savings achieved through setup cost sharing when two or more maintenance actions are grouped. The considered actions include inspections and age-based replacements, with calculations performed over an infinite horizon (indirect grouping). This application was developed by Victor H. R. Lima and Cristiano A. V. Cavalcante.

The application is designed to assist maintenance decision-makers by highlighting the benefits of grouping maintenance actions in hybrid policies, where inspections and age-based replacements can be jointly performed. By considering shared setup costs, this tool helps optimize maintenance schedules and reduce long-term costs.
